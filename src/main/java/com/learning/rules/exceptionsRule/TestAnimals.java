/**
 * Rule :The overriding method CAN throw any unchecked (runtime) exception,
 * regardless of whether the overridden method declares the exception. (More
 * in Chapter 6.)
 * â–  The overriding method must NOT throw checked exceptions that are new
 * or broader than those declared by the overridden method. For example, a
 * method that declares a FileNotFoundException cannot be overridden by
 * a method that declares a SQLException, Exception, or any other non runtime exception
 * unless it's a subclass of FileNotFoundException
 *
 * The overriding method can throw narrower or fewer exceptions. Just because
 * an overridden method "takes risks" doesn't mean that the overriding subclass'
 * exception takes the same risks. Bottom line: An overriding method doesn't
 * have to declare any exceptions that it will never throw, regardless of what the
 * overridden method declares
